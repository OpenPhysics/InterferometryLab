/**
 * FringeSpec.ts
 *
 * The contract between an interferometer model and the fringe renderer.
 *
 * Each screen's model reduces its whole optical layout — arm lengths, mirror
 * tilts, inserted samples, cavity spacing — to a FringeSpec, which says how the
 * optical path difference varies across the detector and how the recombining
 * light adds up. The renderer knows nothing about mirrors or beam splitters; it
 * evaluates this description per pixel.
 *
 * That boundary is deliberate. It keeps three quite different instruments behind
 * one renderer, and it makes the physics a pure function of plain data, so the
 * whole intensity field can be unit-tested without a canvas.
 *
 * ── Detector coordinates ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Positions on the detector are given as (u, v), each running from −1 at one
 * edge to +1 at the other, with (0, 0) on the optical axis. The mapping from
 * (u, v) to a ray angle lives in `apertureTanTheta`.

 * path difference cannot describe the instrument once uncompensated glass is in
 * it. Every group gets its own offset and the renderer adds it before working
 * out either the phase or the coherence envelope.

 *  - `ringOpdNm` — the arm difference (or cavity round trip). Because it is
 *    multiplied by cos θ, rays leaving the axis have a slightly shorter path,

 *    inclination. This is the term the movable mirror changes.
 *  - `tiltXNm` / `tiltYNm` — a wedge between the two wavefronts, from tilting a
 *    mirror. OPD then varies linearly across the detector and the fringes are
 *    straight: fringes of equal thickness.
 *  - `constantOpdNm` — an insert (gas cell, sample slide) that shifts every
