 * Pure spectral maths: how a source's finite linewidth turns into a coherence
 * length, and how a continuous spectrum is discretized for rendering.
 *
 * ── Why a source has a coherence length ───────────────────────────────────────
 * A perfectly monochromatic wave interferes with a delayed copy of itself no
 * matter how large the delay. A real source carries a spread of wavelengths, and
 * each wavelength accumulates a different phase over the same optical path
 * difference (OPD). Beyond some OPD the individual patterns are shifted enough
 * relative to one another that their sum washes out.
 *
 * For a Gaussian spectral line of centre λ₀ and full width at half maximum Δλ,
 * the modulus of the complex degree of coherence is itself a Gaussian in the OPD:
 *
 *      V(Δ) = exp( −σ_k² Δ² / 2 ),     σ_k = 2π σ_λ / λ₀²,   σ_λ = Δλ / 2√(2 ln 2)
 *
 * V is the fringe visibility (I_max − I_min)/(I_max + I_min). It falls to 1/e at
 * Δ ≈ 0.53 λ₀²/Δλ and to about 3 % at Δ = λ₀²/Δλ, which is why λ₀²/Δλ is quoted
 * as *the* coherence length: it is the path difference by which the fringes have
 * effectively gone, not merely faded.
 *
 * ── Discretizing a broadband source ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A white-light source is represented as a handful of adjacent Gaussian groups
 * that tile the visible band, each carrying its own colour and its own analytic
 * visibility envelope. Summing groups (rather than summing bare monochromatic
 * lines) matters: a finite set of monochromatic lines is periodic in Δ, so its
 * fringes would revive at large OPD. Groups with the correct width do not — each
 * one damps on its own, so the total envelope decays once and stays decayed.
