/**
 * CoherenceEnvelopeNode.ts
 *
 * Fringe visibility against optical path difference — the interferogram's
 * envelope, with a marker showing where on it the instrument currently sits.
 *
 * Coherence is the hardest thing on this screen to discover by dragging. The
 * detector shows the visibility at *one* path difference, so a student hunting
 * for the edge of the fringes is sampling a curve they cannot see, one point at
 * a time, across a stage whose full travel is four hundred micrometres. The
 * shape of that curve is the whole of §2 of the model documentation, and every
 * source has a different one:
 *
 *  - a laser is flat at 1 — its coherence length is metres, so nothing the stage
 *    can do will fade the fringes, which is exactly why lasers are used;
 *  - a filtered lamp decays as a Gaussian whose width *is* its coherence length;
 *  - white light is a needle a micrometre wide, which is why the white-light
 *    fringe is so hard to find;
 *  - and sodium does not decay at all — it beats, dying and reviving with a
 *    period set by the D-line spacing. Measuring that period is the classic
 *    undergraduate determination of the doublet separation, and it is invisible
 *    without this plot.
 *
 * The horizontal span therefore cannot be fixed: metres and micrometres both
 * have to be legible. It is chosen from the source's own feature scale, the same
 * way `TransmissionSpectrumNode` rescales itself around the line separation.
